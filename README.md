## Introduction

(Talk about first class functions again with a basic example)

### Create a "First-Class" Function

We're going to create a web greeting! Working in [24 hour time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock),
create a set of conditions that will give the user different greetings
depending on the time that is submitted.

We've given some starter code in `index.html` that contains a form
field and an `h1`. Write your code in `index.js` that will produce 
the following results when the `submit` button is _clicked_:

- If the time is earlier than 12pm, return "Good Morning".
- If the time is between 12pm and 5pm, return "Good Afternoon".
- If the time is later than 5pm, return "Good Evening".
- If any other input is given, return "Hello".
